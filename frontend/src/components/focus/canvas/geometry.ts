/**
 * Canvas geometry — Phase A Session 3.5, extended Session 3.8.
 *
 * Pure-function utilities for the Focus canvas. Zone-relative
 * (anchor-based) positioning replaces Session 3's absolute-pixel
 * model — widgets anchored to "right-rail" always land in the right
 * rail regardless of viewport width.
 *
 * Two coordinate spaces:
 *   - Anchor space — stored in WidgetPosition. Viewport-independent.
 *     `{ anchor, offsetX, offsetY, width, height }`.
 *   - Resolved space — computed at render time via
 *     `resolvePosition(pos, vw, vh)`. A viewport-absolute `Rect`
 *     used for overlap math, hit testing, CSS `left/top/width/
 *     height` styling, and as the intermediate space for drag/
 *     resize computation.
 *
 * Drag flow:
 *   1. Compute current resolved rect.
 *   2. Apply drag delta.
 *   3. Pick new anchor from drop point via
 *      `determineAnchorFromDrop`.
 *   4. Re-project to anchor-offset via `computeOffsetsForAnchor`.
 *   5. Clamp offsets (widget stays fully visible).
 *   6. Reject if resolved rect overlaps the core; else persist.
 *
 * Resize flow (per zone):
 *   1. Compute current resolved rect.
 *   2. Apply zone-specific delta (which edges/corners move).
 *   3. Enforce min size + clamp to canvas.
 *   4. Re-project to anchor-offset, preserving original anchor.
 *
 * Tier detection (Session 3.8 continuous cascade):
 *   Layout is continuous. The three render paths (canvas, stack,
 *   icon) remain but the SWITCH between them happens at geometric
 *   constraints, not fixed viewport pixel thresholds. Core size is
 *   a continuous function of viewport within each tier's min/max
 *   bounds. Transitions between tiers happen exactly when the next
 *   tier's geometric requirement stops being satisfied:
 *
 *     canvas  — widgets fit in reserved margin around core
 *     stack   — stack rail fits alongside a minimum-sized core
 *     icon    — neither fits; floating button + bottom-sheet
 *
 *   Session 3.7.1 introduced content-aware canvas↔stack detection
 *   via `widgetsFitInCanvas`. Session 3.8 extends the same principle
 *   to stack↔icon via `stackFitsAlongsideCore` — replacing the
 *   Session 3.7 `vw < 700` hard pixel threshold. See the matching
 *   "Almost But Not Quite" entry in PLATFORM_QUALITY_BAR.md.

 *    (offsetX, offsetY) + (width, height) fits if the widget's right

 *    naturally occupies the L-shaped reserved area around the corner;
 *    fitting requires avoiding the core rect in AT LEAST ONE axis,
 *    not both.
 *  - **Rail anchors** (`left-rail`, `right-rail`): only the horizontal
 *    band matters — width + offsetX must fit in reservedLeft /
 *    reservedRight. Height can extend the full viewport vertically.
 *  - **Center anchors** (`top-center`, `bottom-center`): only the
 *    vertical band matters — height + offsetY must fit in reservedTop
 *    / reservedBottom. Width spans full viewport horizontally.
 *
 *  All checks use `+ buffer` (default WIDGET_FIT_BUFFER = 16) as
 *  breathing room so widgets don't touch viewport edge or core edge
 *  (reads as cramped).
 *
 *  Returns true if ALL widgets fit. Returns true vacuously for empty

 *  scales smoothly with viewport between the MIN/MAX bounds. Session
 *  3.8 extended the stack formula to also respect CORE_MAX so core
 *  doesn't grow unbounded on ultra-wide viewports and the canvas↔
 *  stack boundary converges at those widths.
 *
 *  - canvas: clamp(MIN, viewport - 2×CANVAS_RESERVED_MARGIN, MAX) —
 *    reserves 100px on each side for canvas widgets
 *  - stack: clamp(MIN, viewport - (rail + margins), MAX) — core takes
 *    remaining viewport width to the left of the rail; capped at MAX
 *  - icon: fills viewport minus small safe padding — widgets live in
 *    bottom-sheet overlay, not around core. No MIN clamp here: icon
 *    mode is for narrow viewports by definition and clamping to MIN
 *    would force horizontal overflow.
 *
 *  MUST stay in sync with Focus.tsx's Popup inline styling and
 *  `widgetsFitInCanvas`'s implicit use of the canvas branch via
 *  `computeCoreRect("canvas", vw, vh)` — findOpenZone's core-
 *  forbidden-zone math drifts from the rendered core otherwise. */
